Question 
GrPA 1 - While Loop - GRADED
✅ Important Note on while loop🔁:
Use while only when the number of iterations is indefinite.
If you can term the steps as do n times, do once for each item, etc. use for loop instead.
If you can only term the steps as do until something happens. Like when user inputs 10.
A bit of wisdom 📖 There are maily two ways in which while loops are used in the context of taking inputs until a terminal word.
